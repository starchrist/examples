# autoware exmaples
Rclcpp examples has been modified to autoware convention structure. branch `dashing-autoware` is a good branch to get familiar with different services impemented in autoware framework.
In order to make `colcon build` working properly, you need to have **example_autoware_interfaces** in the same /src directory with folder /examples.
